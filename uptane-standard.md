## Server side

An Uptane implementation SHALL make the following services available to vehicles:

* Image repository
* Director repository
* Time server

### Image Repository

The Image repository exists to allow the OEM and/or its suppliers to upload images and their associated metadata. It makes these images and their metadata available to vehicles. The Image repository is designed to be primarily controlled by human actors, and updated relatively infrequently.

The Image repository SHALL expose an interface permitting the download of metadata and images. This interface SHOULD be public.

The Image repository SHALL require authorization for writing metadata and images.

The Image repository SHALL provide a method for authorized users to upload images and their associated metadata. It SHALL check that a user writing metadata and images is authorized to do so for that specific image by checking the chain of delegations for the image as described in {{delegations}}.

The Image repository SHALL implement storage which permits authorized users to write an image file using a unique filename, and later read the same file using the same name. It MAY use any filesystem, key-value store, or database that fulfills this requirements.

The Image repository MAY require authentication for read access.

### Director Repository

### Time Server

The Time Server exists to inform vehicles about the current time in cryptographically secure way, since many ECUs in a vehicle will not have a reliable source of time. It receives lists of tokens from vehicles, and returns back a signed sequence that includes the token and the current time.

The Time Server SHALL receive a sequence of tokens from a vehicle representing all of its ECUs. In reponse, it SHALL sign each token together with the current time.

The Time Server SHALL expose a public interface allowing primaries to communicate with it. This communication MAY occur over FTP, FTPS, SFTP, HTTP, or HTTPS.
